# About @CommunityModerationBot

The @CommunityModerationBot helps to :crystal_ball: automagically moderate public Telegram groups and channels by holding back newly posted messages until some randomly selected group/ channel members have approved the message.

# :triangular_ruler: Features

:white_large_square: Posted messages of unprivileged users are being held back until 3 randomly selected group members have reviewed and accepted the message. @CommunityModerationBot takes care of this by picking randomly 5 group members on every held back message and send the message privately to them for review. As soon as 3 of them gave the :+1: approval for releasing the message to the public, the message will be posted on the group/ channel.

:white_large_square: Thresholds for positive approvals and review group size can be customized by a bot admin.

:white_large_square: Automatic member reputation System. After 3 approved messages and zero reqected messages the group/ channel member is being whitelisted and able to post messages without prior review.

:white_large_square: Whitelisting and blacklisting of members.
